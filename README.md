This is the first time I have modified code using GitHub's online editor. Also, this is being done so that I can prepare for work on larger projects.  
I am learning about phone gap. 

# Markdown

This document is written [in markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Lists can be done like this:

1. hey
1. how
    1. sub-bullet
1. are
1. you

Or this:

* hey
* how
    * sub-bullet
* are
* you

Or this:

- hey
- how
    - sub-bullet
- are
- you

# heading

## sub-heading

### sub-sub-heading

Line breaks
won't
show
up
in
markdown
unless you use
two  
spaces  
after  
each  
line.

# Get Git for Windows
[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is GREAT! Get it! Use `git` from the command-line in the bash terminal that comes with it.

# Code blocks

`This is code` within a line.

    this
    is
    code
    using
    indentations (4 spaces)
    
and this:

```
is 
code
using backtick code
fences
```

If in a bulletted list, you must indent 2x as much, or 8 spaces:

1. bulleted
1. list

        this is
        code
        
1. 3rd item
